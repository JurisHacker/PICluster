## Building mqtt (mosquitto) onto the cluster
## The plan is to get each of the cluster nodes to report environmental information to a broker
## then the broker will report to a subscriber (client).
## I'd like to get the subscriber to then update a Pimoroni Unicorn pHat
## The pHat will then use its LEDs to display the environment

## First install Mosquitto client on each of the cluster nodes
