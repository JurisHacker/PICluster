Notes and such about building a Raspberry PI cluster

This started as a simple 4 PI3 cluster, then I heard about ClusterHat (http://clusterhat.com/).  This is a hat for the PI3 that allows
for 4 Pi Zeros to be installed on a PI3.  How could I resist?

So the PI3 is:
    A 1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core ARMv8 CPU
    1GB RAM
    802.11n Wireless LAN
    Bluetooth 4.1
    Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
    

The Pi Zero is
    1Ghz, Single-core CPU
    512MB RAM

So clearly the Pi Zeros won't add much to the mix.  An additional PI3 probably would have provided more power, but this isn't about
building a massive supercomputer.  It is about playing with stuff.
